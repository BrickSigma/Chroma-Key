# Chroma-Key
This is my own version of chroma key software using python and OpenCV.

# How to use
Take a photo of the background of your video, if it's a solid color the results will yield better.  
Record your video with the same background present. Then load in the background and video paths through the `main.py` script.  
Run the script and a new file called `test.mp4` will be produced in the working directory.

# Notice
This is not my completed program, I am still developing it and it is not yet ready for public use.
